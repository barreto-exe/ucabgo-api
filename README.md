# Welcome to the UCAB GO API! ðŸš—ðŸŽ“
This API is designed to support the UCAB GO app, a ride-sharing platform for the UCAB community. With UCAB GO, students, faculty, and staff can easily request rides to and from campus, making transportation more convenient and accessible.

# Technologies Used ðŸ’»
- **.NET 6** - The UCAB GO API is built using .NET 6, a cross-platform framework for building modern applications.

- **Entity Framework Core** - Entity Framework Core is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for the UCAB GO API. It provides a simple way to interact with the database and map database entities to C# objects.

- **MariaDB** - MariaDB is used as the database for the UCAB GO API. It is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its performance, scalability, and reliability.

- **JWT** - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication and authorization in the UCAB GO API. JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

- **Azure Functions** - Azure Functions is used to host the UCAB GO API. It is a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without having to manage infrastructure.

- **Visual Studio** - Visual Studio is used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the UCAB GO API. It provides a powerful set of tools for building, testing, and debugging .NET applications.

These technologies were chosen for their reliability, performance, and ease of use. They provide a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable API that can meet the needs of the UCAB university community.
